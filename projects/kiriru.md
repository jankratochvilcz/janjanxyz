[Kiriru](https://kiriru.janjan.xyz/) is a tiny app to help me learn the cyrillic script. It's written in React as a weekend project (so don't expect unit tests ðŸ˜…). I took this as an opportunity to explore the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), which I found really interesting as an alternative way to organize components.
