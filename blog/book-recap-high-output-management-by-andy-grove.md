[High Output Management](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Andrew_S_Grove_High_Output_Management?id=piCeCgAAQBAJ&hl=en) is a collection of recipes for squeezing more performance out of your organization.

## Overview

**The output of managers is an output of organizational units under their control or influence.** All focus should be on increasing team, not personal, performance.

A lot of Andy’s findings bear similarity to SCRUM. Both seem to be influenced by [Toyota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System). Both focus on continuous process optimization and setting up a system that keeps people challenged and motivated.

## Solid Ideas

**Impacts of defective products are impossible to predict. So, any compromises on quality are unacceptable.** Recognizing it can lead to a big change in prioritization patterns. When you recognize reliability as an attribute that cannot be compromised on, saying _no_ becomes easy. Since we decided to make reliability a priority for our Todoist for Windows 10 app, saying a confident _no_ to projects that would divert our focus has become much easier.

**A manager’s day ends when they’re tired and ready to go home, not when they are done. Managers are never done.** It’s a feeling that’s hard to escape. Setting more explicit daily/weekly goals could be a good start to mitigate this feeling.

**Eliciting peak performance means going against something or somebody.** This is an idea [shared with John Legere, T-Mobile US’s CEO](https://hbr.org/2017/01/t-mobiles-ceo-on-winning-market-share-by-trash-talking-rivals). Having something to compare against can be a powerful motivator for some people.

**During performance reviews, assess actual performance, not potential.** Andy is very strict about assessing a person’s performance. Talking about potential is best left for 1:1s.

Finding a way to create such opportunities could help create a more aligned and connected organization.
